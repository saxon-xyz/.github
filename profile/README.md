# About Us

Since inception, our thesis has been that blockchain technology will radically change how we store and transfer value but, of course, change rarely takes place overnight.

It is often said that there is a tendency to overestimate the change that will occur in the short term and underestimate the change that will unfold in the long term.

Whilst many digital asset issuers and advisors have perished in the short-sighted pursuit of hype, Saxon has maintained a long-term view from day one.

Nodes as a Service for Investors and Developers. Scale your network using our cloud-native experts and our infrastructure as code
